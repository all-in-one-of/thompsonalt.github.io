I am a VFX artist and tool developer based in Chicago Illinois currently working at [Carbon](https://carbonvfx.com). This website has a collection of my notes and resources primarily regarding VFX and pipeline development. I specialize in Nuke compositing and Houdini FX with significant experience in Python tool development.

This is hosted using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) on [Github](https://github.com/thompsonalt/thompsonalt.github.io).
